🎉 Exciting Update! 🎉

I’m thrilled to share that I’ve just completed my third task as a Web Development Intern at SkillCraftTechnology! 🚀

For this task, I developed a fully responsive and interactive Tic Tac Toe game 🕹️ using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. The project focuses on creating a modern and user-friendly interface, complete with beautiful animations, real-time interaction, and a smooth gaming experience.

🔑 Key Features of the Game:
Interactive Gameplay: Play as X or O in a classic two-player Tic Tac Toe game.
Winning & Draw Detection: Real-time game state tracking to declare a winner or a draw.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
Modern UI: Enhanced with gradients, shadows, transitions, and animations to create a realistic feel.

This experience has strengthened my skills in:

Front-End Development
Responsive Web Design
JavaScript for Interactive Applications
Using Tailwind CSS for Quick Styling
A big thank you to the team at SkillcraftTechnology for giving me the opportunity to work on this amazing project. 🙌

Looking forward to learning more and growing with each task! 🚀
